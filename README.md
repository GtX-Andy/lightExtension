## Documentation

#### Running Lights (DRL):
These lights are activated whenever the vehicle is started. This is possible in the base game as of FS22 and remains for conversion compatibility mainly.

#### Strobe Lights:
These lights are activated with the `Beacon Light` key. In FS22 there is the ability to use 'multiBlink' for similar results however this spec allows more complex patterns.

> Method 1: Uses a string of X and - characters to define the sequence times, X represents ON state and - represents OFF state for the given 'blinkStepLength' in seconds. This is a similar method to that used in `ETS2 and ATS` and will be more familiar to some mod makers.

```xml
<strobeLight blinkStepLength="0.06" blinkPattern="X-X-X-X------X--"/>
```

> Method 2: A string of millisecond values each separated with a space are used to create an alternating light sequence. When `invert="true"` the first ms value will represent OFF.

```xml
<strobeLight sequence="600 600 200 200" invert="false"/>
```

> Method 3: Allow the randomiser to create the sequence using the given values or default values.

```xml
<strobeLight minOn="100" maxOn="100" minOff="100" maxOff="400"/>
```

#### Beacon Sound:
Plays a sample when beacon or strobe lights are active. Useful if you wish to include a siren or beacon rotor sound.

#### Auto Combine Beacon Lights
Activates the Beacon and  Strobe lights when the grain hopper reaches the set percentage.

> Default value is 80 % if not specified in the XML

```xml
<autoCombineBeaconLightsÂ percent="80"/>
```

## Example Mod
